    "The Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) assumes that, when making a decision between two options, noisy evidence in favor of one over the other option is integrated over time until a pre-set threshold is reached. This threshold indicates how much of this relative evidence is enough to initiate a response. Since the incoming evidence is noisy, the integrated evidence becomes more reliable as time passes. Therefore, higher thresholds lead to more accurate decisions. However, the cost of increasing the threshold is an increase of decision time. In addition, difficulty affects decisions: When confronted with an easier choice (e.g., between a very good and a very bad option), the integration process reaches the threshold faster, meaning that less time is needed to make a decision and that decisions are more accurate. The DDM also assumes that a portion of the RTs reflects processes that are unrelated to the decision time itself, such as motor processes, and that can differ across participants. Because of this dependency between noise in the information, accuracy, and speed of decisions, the DDM is able to simultaneously predict the probability of choosing one option over the other (i.e., accuracy) and the shape of the two RT distributions corresponding to the two choice options. Importantly, by fitting the standard DDM, we assume that repeated choices are independent of each other, and discard information about the order of the choices and the feedback after each choice. To formalize the described cognitive processes, the simple DDM has four core parameters: The drift rate $v$, which describes how fast the integration of evidence is, the threshold a (with $a > 0$), that is the amount of integrated evidence necessary to initiate a response, the starting-point bias, that is the evidence in favor of one option prior to evidence accumulation, and the non-decision time Ter (with $0 \\leq T_{er} < RT_{min}$), the part of the response time that is not strictly related to the decision process ($RT = decision time + T_{er}$ ). Because, in our case, the position of the options was randomized to either the left or the right screen position, we assumed no starting-point bias and only considered drift rate, threshold, and non-decision time. The following figure illustrates this model:"
